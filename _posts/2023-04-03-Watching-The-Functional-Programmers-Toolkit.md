# Watching: The Functional Programmers Toolkit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrp_LZ-XGsY

In this talk: Monoid, Functor, Monad, Applicative

## Core principles of FP

* Functions are things
* Composition is used everywhere

## Functions are things

Tunnel: Something goes in, something does out. (even functions)

OOPattern: "Strategy" - A function that takes a function any an input and returns an output.

You dont need a "adapter"-pattern to connect two pieces - they always connect together.

## FP Philospohy

* Design functions that do one thing well - (the solid priciples also apply to FP)
  * but they can be reused.
  
* Design functions to work together (design with unkowns)

* Use types to ensure that inputs match outputs

## Tool Nr.1 - Monoids
