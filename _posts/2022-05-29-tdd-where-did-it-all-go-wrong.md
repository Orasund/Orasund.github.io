Type driven might be good, but it slows everything done.

* Pipeline slows down
* Time until the code gets shipped slows down
* Tests get added that actually don't help a lot
* Refactoring gets harder

Instead one should focus the tests on the individual use cases.

* Make test that implement the feature not the implementation detail.
