Hi, my name is Lucas Payr.

I started this blog when I started with my first Job in 2021. Before that I did my masters in Computer mathematics and started being active in the Elm community, even wrote my master thesis about it.

This blog is meant as a developer journal that I use during working to write down any interesting blogs, book, podcasts or videos i come across. Sometime I also write opinion peaces, mostly about functional programming.
