> Cognitive load theory defines cognitive load as the amount of information that working memory holds at one time. The idea is that the human brain is limited in that capacity. Psychologists have identified the load to be about 3-52 “units of information” (also called “chunks”). This space appears to be quite limited.

> * Intrinsic cognitive load is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific (instructional) topic.
> * Extraneous cognitive load is generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners and is under the control of instructional designers.
> * Germane cognitive load refers to the work that is put into constructing a long-lasting store of knowledge or schema.
