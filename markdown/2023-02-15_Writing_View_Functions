I recently stumpled appon my old version of [elm-ui-widgets](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Orasund/elm-ui-widgets/latest/) and started thinking.
Over the span of 4 year my style of programming views changed and it was interesting to see my mindshift.

We will now use the example of a modal to see and appraoch it from different directions.

> A Modal is a pop-up window that overlays everything else.The background gets blured and you can close the window only if you press a button or click outside the window.

First approach would be to create a Model, view and update function.

```
modal : { enabled : True } -> Html msg -> Html msg
```
