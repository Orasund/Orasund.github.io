# 1. Building Abstractions with Functions

In the first chapter we define

* arithmatics over numbers
* constants (const)
* functions (function name(arugment) {return statement})
* if expressions (value ? trueBranch : falseBranch)

Tree Accumulation := Evaluating a Tree by combining branches

substitution Model of a function := Beta reduction

when introducing higher order function, the book uses named functions instead of unnamed lambda functions

## Conclusion

The first chapter covers everything to make a language turing complete. The example are standard textbook examples.
